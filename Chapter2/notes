There are two main projects for this chapter. 

1. The first project uses file addition2.php

2. The second project uses files validate.php, process.php, and code.txt.

Create file code.txt at the document root (/var/www/html in this example) and change the owner of the file:

$ sudo touch /var/www/html/code.txt
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/code.txt
